# nuxeo-platform-indexing-gateway

## Overview

This nuxeo platform plugin provides a simple WebService interface that can be used to :

 - browse the repository data

 - know what has changed in the repository in a given time range

 - read all data of a document (attributes, ACLs, Blobs ...)

This WS API is typically used for external indexers that needs to crawl Nuxeo repository and be able to know what has changed between 2 indexing.

## Recommendation and Warnings

### SOAP API

The SOAP API try to be compliant with most SOAP dialect and WS stacks.
This generates some limitations.

#### Authentication

Authentication is managed at Application level.

This means that the typical call flow will be :

 - connect(Login/Password) (return token)
 - doSomething(token, ...)
 - doSomething(token, ...)
 - doSomething(token, ...)
 - disconnect(token)

The client is responsible for calling disconnect at some point otherwise a leak will appear on the Nuxeo side.

#### Blobs management

SOAP badly handles Blob content and MTOM as caused a lot of incompatibilities.
So the current WebService uses a very simple approach :

 - use JAXB byte[] serialization in base64 : that is clearly not a good idea for performances and memory management

 - send a REST URL that can be used by the client to download the Blobs outside of the SOAP envelop

The choice of the format is left to the client via a boolean flag (useDownloadUrl).

#### Thread Safety

The token provided upon connection is supposed to be used by only one client thread at a time.
If for some reason, the client can not enforce that, a server side synchronization can be activated (use nuxeo.indexing.gateway.forceSync property).

### Security Mapping

Nuxeo will export all data about the Documents :

 - attributes (simple and complex)
 - Blobs
 - life-cycle
 - security descriptor

The tricky part is usually to handle security descriptor so that they can be understood by the client.

Since usually the client only need a *read_acl*, the WebService can provide that and also allows to plug a server side custom logic to define how the ACL linearization must be done.

For this the WebService can be contributed with a custom implementation of IndexingAdapter via an extension point.
